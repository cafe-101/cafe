Welcome to the **Cafe** software suite! This is a high-performance, multi-tenant monorepo designed to scale across multiple cafe branches. It includes backend APIs, head-office web portals, and customer/branch mobile apps.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Package Manager:** `pnpm` (Workspace) + `turborepo`
- **Node Environment:** Node.js >= 24
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 18.4 + Prisma ORM (Multi-tenant schema)
- **Caching & Queues:** Redis 8.8.0 (using raw Redis Streams/Lists for background tasks)
- **Storage:** LocalStack S3 API (v4.14.0)
- **Backend API:** Fastify (Path-based routing, Zod validation)
- **Web Frontend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router, Tailwind CSS v4)
- **Mobile Apps:** Expo / React Native (`customer-mobile`, `branch-tablet`)
- **Payments:** Stripe (Web, Native Apple Pay & Google Pay)

## ⚙️ Port Allocations

To ensure zero conflicts during local development, services are mapped to a strictly assigned `404X` block. If `.env` is missing, these fallback ports are used automatically:

- `apps/api`: **4040**
- `apps/customer-mobile`: **4041**
- `apps/hq-web`: **4042**
- `apps/branch-tablet`: **4043**
- **PostgreSQL (18.4)**: `4044`
- **Redis (8.8.0)**: `4045`
- **LocalStack S3**: `4046`

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: `v24` or higher
- **pnpm**: `v11.6.0`
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install all workspace dependencies:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:cafe-101/cafe.git
cd cafe
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Configure your environment variables for local development:
```bash
# Setup Docker infrastructure environment
cp docker/.env-example docker/.env

# Setup API environment
cp apps/api/.env-example apps/api/.env
```

### 4. Start Infrastructure
Launch the local PostgreSQL, Redis, and LocalStack instances via Docker Compose:
```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
cd ..
```

### 5. Run Development Servers
Start all applications and packages in parallel utilizing Turborepo:
```bash
# Run all apps in development mode
pnpm dev

# Or build the entire monorepo
pnpm build
```
